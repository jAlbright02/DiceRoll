# DiceRoll

## Why did I do this
I decided on creating a mobile app from scratch because I wanted exposure to a new language outside of my course.
After following along with [Android's Kotlin course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course) it inspired me to make something I could actually use myself. It is helpful for small tabletop boardgames that I sometimes play.

## What does it do
The application gives the user the option to roll up to 6 different dice.
It is mainly for tabletop games which need large amounts of dice for each player to roll.
After the roll, it also displays the total of all the dice rolled.

## Art
All art within the project was made by me using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

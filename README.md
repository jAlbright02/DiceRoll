# DiceRoll

## What does it do
The application gives the user the option to roll up to 8 different dice.
It is mainly for tabletop games which need large amounts of dice for each player to roll.
After the roll it also displays the total of all the dice rolled.

## Art
All art within the project was made by me using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
